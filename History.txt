== 1.0.7 2008-11-26
* 1 major enhancement
 * When a collection of photos is fetched (e.g. by Flickr#search), a PhotoCollection object is now returned, a type of array, which allows easy access to the pagination information returned by Flickr (e.g. total items, pages, etc). Previously this info was lost
* Minor enhancements:
 * Refactored parsing of response when getting info about photo (public API is not changed). 
 * All returned info is now parsed and stored (previously only some attributes were)
 * A record is kept of whether info has been previously fetched from Flickr (avoids unnecessary extra calls)
 * Improved User#getInfo. No longer makes API call for pretty_url (which was in addition to main getInfo call) or photos_url
* Bugfixes
 * Fixed Photo#source not to make unnecessary API call
 * Fixed User#url not to make unnecessary API call

== 1.0.6 2008-07-30
* Bugfixes:
  * fixed Flickr#photos when used for searching
  * fixed Flickr::Photo#url to not use usernames (if the user changes their username, the url will wrong)
  * fixed Flickr#related_tags
  * Flickr::Photo#to_s was making unnecessary API calls
  * fixed 'test' Rake task
  * fixed 'gem' Rake task
* Minor enhancements:
  * added Flickr#search as an alias for Flickr#photos in its search mode
  * added Flickr#recent as an alias for Flickr#photos for recent photos
  * added Flickr::Photo#pretty_url for the URL that includes a username if present
  * added Flickr::Photo#size_url which is like url except 'Medium' works the same as other sizes
  * allow lowercase ('medium') and symbol (:medium) forms for sizes
  * internal code cleanup

== 1.0.5 2008-05-12

* 1 major change:
  * Updated and refactored Flickr::Group class and Flickr#groups method to work with current Flickr API. Flickr#groups now searches for given group, rather than groups.getActiveList (which no longer exists as Flickr API call)
* Minor enhancements:
  * Tweaked internals so new client instance isn't created each time new object (e.g. photo, user) is created
  * Improved test coverage
  
== 1.0.4 2008-05-11

* 1 major enhancement:
  * Added authentication facility as per current Flickr API
* 3 minor enhancements:
  * Improved test suite
  * Improved API for creating Flickr objects (old one still works)
  * Protected methods that are only used internally (e.g. request, request_url)

== 1.0.3 2008-04-18

* Various bugfixes:
  * User instantiation was broken (wrong number of params passed)
  * Instantiating photos failed in several places if single photo returned
  * Photosets#getInfo would always fail as the parameter name should be photoset_id, not photosets_id
  * Removed call to flickr.people.getOnlineList in Flickr#users as that call is no longer in the Flickr API
* Performance improvements:
  * Url and image source uri now generated without a call to the Flickr API, as per the Flickr API docs
